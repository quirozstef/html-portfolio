<h1> Best Movies of my 2023 </h1>
 <h2>By Stef</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Air </h3>
<p>  This is a move based on the history of Nike Air Jordan's foundations
    and how Jordan was between Nike and Adidas.
</p>
<h3> Burnt </h3>
<p> As I have an obsession with cooking movies, this one lead actor 
    Brandley Cooper as an British Chef trying to get back to the highest kitches
    in Paris
</p>

<h3> Beau is Afraid </h3>
<p> Preatty creapy movie produced by Ari Aster, it's really a must. </p>
